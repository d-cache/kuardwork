Ingress is under a different API since this book has been published. Ingress can get pretty complicated with annotations that this book didn't get into in this chapter. Made a few examples of how ingress can work. Nice to see how quickly AVI spins up a LB in front of services. In the enablement session, we used http proxy instead of ingress objects which CJ said is the way ingress is apparently going.
