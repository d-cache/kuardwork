Honestly not sure what to think going into this chapter. I know configmaps are used to inject command line args or define variables. Secrets are the same but speficially for sensitive into like TLS certs and keys.


Pretty much that is it. page 164 drops a good line about piping k create secret generic with --from-file properties piped to k replace -f -. This redirects the output to stdin, updating the secret. 


Added test text
